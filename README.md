# BasketballAnalytics
As the name suggests, this project is regarding ANALYSING and comparing styles of top Basketball Players in the world.
I love playing basketball, which made me excited about something that I learned at  _R Programming Course by Kirill Eremenko_ into a self project.

In this project, we will give some interesting insights on playing style and accuracy of some players just by analysing data using <b>R programming</b>!
